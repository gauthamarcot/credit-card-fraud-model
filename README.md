# credit-card-fraud-model

This code uses the TensorFlow library to create a simple neural network model with two fully connected layers and dropout layers in between, in order to prevent overfitting. The sigmoid activation function is used on the output layer to get the probability of a transaction being fraudulent. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss and the accuracy of the model is evaluated on the test dataset.
